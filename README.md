# CHiCAGO_for-Radicl-seq
This repo contains the scripts for running Radicl-seq data on both the chicago and chicane algorithms.

# Background
RADICL-Seq, as described in the [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14337-6#MOESM1),maps genome-wide RNAâ€“chromatin interactions in intact nuclei. 
Here we have applied algorithms meant for the anlaysis of DNA-DNA interaction datasets in the many-to-all context (such as Capture Hi-C) to analysis this data.

## chicago_analysis
* Scripts specifcally for the analysis of RADICL-Seq data using CHICAGO, see [publication](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0992-2)

## chicane_analysis
* Scripts and data specifcally for the analysis of RADICL-Seq data using CHICHANE, see [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00498-1)

### Analysis

using Chicane:
